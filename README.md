# README

This is to document my first time using Ruby on Rails. I started by following the official guide:
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Aside from what's included in the tutorial, I styled the page using tailwind and added some extra functionality like an error page that appears if you try and navigate to an article via an invalid ID.

Run using `bin/dev` in WSL console.
